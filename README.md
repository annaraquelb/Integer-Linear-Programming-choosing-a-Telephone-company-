example 9.1-3  Operations Research An Introduction by Hamdy A. Taha JOBCO
"I have been approached by three telephone companies to subscribe to their long-distance service in the United States. MaBell will charge a flat $16 per month plus $.25 a minute. PaBell
will charge $25 a month but will reduce the per-minute cost to $.21. As for BabyBell, the flat
monthly charge is $18, and the cost per min is $.22. I usually make an average of 200 minutes of
long-distance calls a month. Assuming that I do not pay the flat monthly fee unless I make calls
and that I can apportion my calls among all three companies as I please, how should I use the
three companies to minimize my monthly telephone bill?"
